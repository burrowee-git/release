#!/bin/sh
# Burrowee inner installer — gateway (POSIX sh).
#
# Ships at the ROOT of the verified release zip as `install.sh`. The outer
# bootstrap verifies the zip (minisign + sha256) and ONLY THEN execs this with
# cwd = the unzipped dir, so the binaries sit alongside this script. It installs
# them into PREFIX/bin (default $HOME/.local/bin). Set BURROWEE_UNINSTALL to
# remove them instead. Set BURROWEE_UNITS_ONLY=1 to write+load both service
# units without touching binaries or running bootstrap. Set BURROWEE_UPDATE=1
# to run update mode: per-binary sha256 change detection, transactional swap,
# and a final BURROWEE_CHANGED=<names> line. In update mode, BURROWEE_FORCE=1
# bypasses the sha256 check and re-places every serve binary (the `--force`
# full-reinstall path — the diff would otherwise skip an identical version).
#
# Service model: the BINARIES stay per-user (PREFIX/bin, default
# ~/.local/bin), but the service units are SYSTEM-level and the daemon they
# start runs as ROOT, so the gateway starts at boot without a GUI login:
# /Library/LaunchDaemons on macOS, /etc/systemd/system on Linux. Its config and
# data live under the SYSTEM roots ($SYS_CONFIG_DIR / $SYS_DATA_DIR), named
# explicitly in the unit rather than left to resolve from whoever's environment
# the daemon happens to inherit. System steps run via sudo (prompting on the
# controlling tty; with no tty and no cached credentials the unit step aborts
# with guidance).
#
# Because a root-scheme unit runs as nobody in particular, it records no owner
# and the single system slot is free for any installer to replace. Only a
# LEGACY per-user unit (one that still carries UserName / User=) is owned, and
# replacing another user's needs consent — a /dev/tty prompt, or
# BURROWEE_FORCE_SERVICE_OVERRIDE=1 when non-interactive.
#
# The unit body must stay byte-identical to what the gateway's own renderer
# emits (internal/gateway/service_install.go: LaunchdPlist / SystemdUnit and
# their updater twins). Both writers rewrite whenever content differs and then
# reload, so any divergence here does not merely disagree — it makes the two
# writers fight, booting the daemon out on every refresh.

# each one that completes. It is a no-op unless one applies, so this may be

# the gateway so its state is at rest while it is copied, and leaves the restart

# It places no units and knows nothing about them. Unit placement is render_units

# a migration would mean re-entering this script via `service install` and
